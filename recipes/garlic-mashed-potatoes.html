        <h4>Ingredients</h4>

            <li>5 large garlic cloves, peeled and smashed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>⅓ cup unsalted butter, cut into 8 pieces, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>¾ cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>

            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Combine potatoes, garlic, and 1 tablespoon of the salt in a medium saucepan with enough water to cover by 1 inch. Bring to a boil over high. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until potatoes are fork-tender, 10 to 12 minutes.</li>

            <li>Using a potato masher, mash in milk until smooth. Stir in 1 teaspoon salt and white pepper.</li>
            <li>Transfer potatoes to a serving bowl and top with more butter, if desired.</li>
